Multilabel text classification: multiple contexts in NLP

In this project I applied the multilabel classification.
I knew and differentiated the multilabel and multiclass classifications.
I applied multilabel sorting to sort tags from Stackoverflow questions.
I learned the metrics of reviews for multilabel rating models. 
Finally, I got to know Scikit-Multilearn, a specific library to work with multilabel classification.
